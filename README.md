# godot-third-person-game

This is my attempt at creating a third-person game using godot.
It will feature dark-souls inspired gameplay and leveldesign.

With this project, my goals are as follows:
* Learn to use common programming patterns, especially those used in game development
* Get more familiar with the Godot game engine
* Work on a larger project for a longer period of time
